# monkey scripts

Collection of userscripts that I've thrown together to try and improve my own browsing experience. I'm primarily using FireMonkey so that's what these scripts mainly target for compatibility. Side note: I am not really a programmer so these scripts are probably not to be trusted if you are not me, apologies in advance.
